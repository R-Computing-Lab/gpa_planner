# GPA Planning Tool (Shiny App)

This interactive GPA planning tool is built in [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/), designed to help students understand and project how their grades in upcoming semesters can affect their overall GPA. 
It is especially useful for students on academic probation or those aiming to reach a GPA threshold for graduation, financial aid, or program retention.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This app is **student-focused**, allowing users to input the exact academic data they see in their transcript or online portal â€” such as:

- Cumulative hours attempted and earned  
- GPA hours  
- Current cumulative GPA  
- Program GPA  
- Class standing and load status  
- Planned credits for next semester  
- Target GPA (e.g., moving from 1.7 to 1.9)

The app then:

- Projects cumulative GPA outcomes if the student earns all Aâ€™s, Bâ€™s, Câ€™s, etc.
- Calculates the exact average grade (on a 4.0 scale) needed in the next term to hit the desired GPA.
- Provides a clear breakdown of what this means in terms of letter grades.


The app allows users to input data such as cumulative GPA, attempted/earned hours, GPA hours, and planned credits for an upcoming term, and see what grades they would need to raise their GPA to a target level.
